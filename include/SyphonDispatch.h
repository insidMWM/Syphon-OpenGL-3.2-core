/*
 Syphon Dispatch handles performing a task in the background such that
 
 - Tasks from a single source happen serially
 - Threads are shared where possible
 - Threads calling Syphon Dispatch never block waiting for background tasks
 
 Why not just use dispatch_queues?
 
 - Syphon Dispatch uses fewer threads
 - dispatch_async must copy a block every time it is called, Syphon Dispatch can re-use the same block.
